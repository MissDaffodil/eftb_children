# Warm-up: Number of correct trials
## Across the sample
```{r}
table(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Warm.up_NrCorrectTrials)
```
Out of the 148 children, *1**05 children (71%) had both warm-up trials correct**, 42 (28%) had 1 trial correct and 1 child had no warm-up trial correct.

```{r}
WM.boxes.valid.warmup <- subset(WM.boxes.valid, Condition == "warmup")

PropCorrectWarmup <- aggregate(Correct_P1 ~ ID, WM.boxes.valid.warmup, mean)

mean(PropCorrectWarmup$Correct_P1)
sd(PropCorrectWarmup$Correct_P1)
min(PropCorrectWarmup$Correct_P1)
max(PropCorrectWarmup$Correct_P1)

shapiro.test(PropCorrectWarmup$Correct_P1)
wilcox.test(PropCorrectWarmup$Correct_P1, mu = 0.25, alternative = "two.sided")
t.test(PropCorrectWarmup$Correct_P1, mu = 0.25, alternative = "two.sided")
```
The mean proportion of correct trials in the warm-up was 0.85 (SD = 0.24, range 0-1).



## By age groups (at midtesting)
```{r}
table(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Warm.up_NrCorrectTrials, WM.boxes.valid.TT1$AgeGroup_midtesting)
```

- **3y (n = 64): 41 (64%)** had both trials correct, 23 (36%) had 1 trial correct
- **4y (n = 72): 41 (75%)** had both trials correct, 23 (24%) had 1 trial correct, 1 child had no trial correct
- 5y (n = 11): 41 (82%) had both trials correct, 2 (18%) had 1 trial correct
- 6y (n = 1): had both trials correct

## By mediansplit (entire sample)
```{r}
table(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Warm.up_NrCorrectTrials, WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Mediansplit_midtesting_entiresample)
```

- **young (n = 74): 48 (65%)** had both trials correct, 26 (35%) had 1 trial correct
- **old (n = 74): 57 (77%)** had both trials correct, 16 (22%) had 1 trial correct, 1 child had no trial correct


# Test: Number of correct searches
## Across the sample
```{r}
mean(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Test.NrCorrectSearches)
sd(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Test.NrCorrectSearches)
min(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Test.NrCorrectSearches)

hist(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Test.NrCorrectSearches)
shapiro.test(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Test.NrCorrectSearches)
```
The mean number of correct searches in the test trials is 4.09 (SD = 1.44, range 1-8). 50% of the children have 4 searches or less correct. The DV is not normally distributed, W = 0.942, p < .001.

### Boxplot:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

p<-  ggplot(
  data=WM.boxes.valid.TT1, aes(x=rep(1, 148), y=Test.NrCorrectSearches)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "black")+
  ylim(0,8)+
  xlim(0,2)+
  labs(x="",y="Number of correct searches")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank())+
  ggtitle("WM Boxes")

p + theme_bw() + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank())+ theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) + theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +  geom_hline(yintercept=2, linetype="dashed", color = "red") + geom_count()
```

### Does performance deviate from chance?
Use "one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test" (is a non-parametric alternative to one-sample t-test when the data cannot be assumed to be normally distributed. Itâ€™s used to determine whether the median of the sample is equal to a known standard value (i.e. theoretical value))

The probability of getting a correct search on one platform by chance is 0.25. 0.25*8 = 2, so by chance, one should get 2 trials correct
```{r}
wilcox.test(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Test.NrCorrectSearches, mu = 2)
```
Children's mean number of correct searches (4.09, SD = 1.44, range 1-8) is significantly higher than what we would expect by chance (2 trials correct), V = 7967, p < .001.

wilcox.test(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Test.NrCorrectSearches ~ WM.boxes.valid.TT1$Mediansplit_midtesting_entiresample, paired = FALSE, alternative = "greater")
```
The variable "number of correct searches" is not normally distributed (old: W = 0.929, p < .001; young: W = 0.935, p < .001).
Older children perform significantly better than younger children (one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test, W = 3272, p = .018).

### Does performance deviate from chance?
```{r}
wilcox.test(young$Test.NrCorrectSearches, mu = 2)

```
In the test trials, on platform 1, the mean number of mistakes was 1.74 (SD = 1.02, range 0-4). The variable "number of mistakes on platform 1" was not normally distributed, W = 0.905, p < .001. 

### Does this performance deviate from chance?
On platform 1, if one would choose completely randomly, one would expect to find 0.25 * 4 = 1 reward, i.e., to make 3 mistakes
```{r}
wilcox.test(WM_Boxes_NumberMistakesP1$Correct_P1, mu = 3)
```
The number of mistakes made on platform 1 (1.74, SD = 1.02, range 0-4) is significantly smaller than what would be expected by chance (1), V = 108, p < .001.

In the test trials, on platform 1, the mean number of mistakes was 0.43 (SD = 0.25, range 0-1). The variable "mean number of mistakes on platform 1" was not normally distributed, W = 0.905, p < .001. 

### Does this performance deviate from chance?
On platform 1, if one would choose completely randomly, the propbability of making an error in each trial is 0.75.
```{r}
wilcox.test(WM_Boxes_MeanNumberMistakesP1$Correct_P1, mu = 0.75)

wilcox.test(WM_Boxes_NumberMistakesAcrossBothPlatforms$Count_mistakes_pertrial, mu = 1.5)
```
Across the test trials, the mean number of mistakes per trial was 0.98 (SD = 0.36, range 0-1.75). This variable is not normally distributed, W = 0.942, p < .001. Children's mean number of mistakes is significantly lower than what would be expected by chance (0.75 + 075 = 1.5), V = 34, p < .001.

# Can age and testing location predict children's proportion of correct searches?
```{r}
library(lme4)

WM.boxes.valid.TT1$z.age=as.vector(scale(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$AgeMonths_midtesting))#transform age to mean of 0 and SD of 1
mean(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$z.age)#check whether it has worked
sd(WM.boxes.valid.TT1$z.age)

res <- lm(ProportionCorrectinTest ~ z.age + TestingLocation + z.age:TestingLocation, data = WM.boxes.valid.TT1)
```

## Check of assumptions
1) Normality of residuals
```{r}
hist(residuals(res), probability=T)

#add line:
x=seq(from=min(residuals(res)),
to=max(residuals(res)), length.out=100)
lines(x=x, y=dnorm(x, mean=0,
sd=sd(residuals(res))))

#a safer option is to look at the qq plot:
qqnorm(residuals(res));qqline(residuals(res))

plot(residuals(res))
```
Histogram looks fairly normal. The qq-plot reveals that small values are too large and large values are too small - see also the histogram.

2) Homogeneity of residuals
```{r}
plot(fitted(res), residuals(res), pch=19)
```
A pattern is visible after all - this might be problematic.

3) Is there a correlation between absolute residuals and fitted values?
```{r}
cor.test(fitted(res), abs(residuals(res)))
```
No, so this seems ok.

4) Influence diagnostics
DFFits
```{r}
dffits(res)
max(abs(dffits(res)))
hist(dffits(res))
plot(dffits(res))
```
DFFit: Values around 2 are reason to worry, but the maximum value is 0.68, so this is ok.

DFBetas
```{r}
round(cbind(coefficients(res), coefficients(res)+
t(apply(X=dfbeta(res), MARGIN=2, FUN=range))), 5)

plot(dfbeta(res)[,1])#needs to be done by column
plot(dfbeta(res)[,2])
plot(dfbeta(res)[,3])
```
DFBeta: looks good, little variation.

Cook's distance
```{r}
max(cooks.distance(res))
plot(cooks.distance(res))
```
Cook's distance: values above 1 are reason to worry, but our maximum value is 0.11.


Leverage
```{r}
max(as.vector(influence(res)$hat))
plot(as.vector(influence(res)$hat))

length(coefficients(res))# this is calculating k, which is the number of predictors
2*(4+1)/148 
3*(4+1)/148 
```
Leverage: values > 2*(k+1)/n or > 3*(k+1)/n are a reason to worry (k = number of predictors); in our case the thresholds are 0.07 and 0.10, and our max value is 0.11, so there is evidence of some influential cases.

```{r}
null<-lm(ProportionCorrectinTest ~ 1, data = WM.boxes.valid.TT1)
anova(null, res, test="Chisq")
```
Together, age, testing location, and the interaction between age and testing location explain the data better than a null model only containing the intercept, X2(3) = 0.55, p < .001.

Effect of interaction
```{r}
res.nointer <- lm(ProportionCorrectinTest ~ z.age + TestingLocation, data = WM.boxes.valid.TT1)
anova(res.nointer, res, test="Chisq")
```
The interaction term does not increase model fit, X2(1) = 0.00, p = .910, so we exclude it from the model.

```{r}
res <- lm(ProportionCorrectinTest ~ z.age + TestingLocation, data = WM.boxes.valid.TT1)
anova(null, res, test="Chisq")
```
Together, age and testing location explain the data better than a null model only containing the intercept, X2(2) = 0.55, p < .001.

```{r}
summary(res)
drop1(res)
cbind(coefficients(res), confint(res))
```
There is a significant effect of age (X2(1) = 0.239, p = .004) and testing location (X2(1) = 0.359, p < .001). With each standard deviation increase in age, the proportion correct increases by 0.04 (95% CI [0.01; 0.01]) percentage points. When going from Edinburgh to Fife, the expected score for a child of mean age decreases by 0.10 (95% CI [0.04; 0.16]) percentage points.


# Accounting for BPVS score: Can age and testing location predict children's proportion of correct searches?

sd(WM.boxes.valid.TT1.BPVS$z.age)

res <- lm(ProportionCorrectinTest ~ BPVS_Score + z.age + TestingLocation + z.age:TestingLocation, data = WM.boxes.valid.TT1.BPVS)
```

```{r}
null<-lm(ProportionCorrectinTest ~ 1, data = WM.boxes.valid.TT1.BPVS)
anova(null, res, test="Chisq")
```
Together, BPVS score, age, testing location, and the interaction between age and testing location explain the data better than a null model only containing the intercept, X2(4) = 0.665, p < .001.

Effect of interaction
```{r}
res.nointer <- lm(ProportionCorrectinTest ~ BPVS_Score + z.age + TestingLocation, data = WM.boxes.valid.TT1.BPVS)
anova(res.nointer, res, test="Chisq")
```
The interaction term does not increase model fit, X2(1) = 0.00, p = .872, so we exclude it from the model.

```{r}
res <- lm(ProportionCorrectinTest ~ BPVS_Score + z.age + TestingLocation, data = WM.boxes.valid.TT1.BPVS)
anova(null, res, test="Chisq")
```
Together, BPVS score, age and testing location explain the data better than a null model only containing the intercept, X2(3) = 0.665, p < .001.

```{r}
summary(res)
drop1(res)
cbind(coefficients(res), confint(res))
```
There is a significant effect of age (X2(1) = 0.293, p = .001) and testing location (X2(1) = 0.300, p = .001), but not of BPVS score (X2(1) = 0.011, p = .522).
